      <description>Common Operational Data Common Operational Datasets (CODs) are authoritative reference datasets needed to support operations and decision-making for all actors involved in a humanitarian response. CODs are &amp;lsquo;best available&amp;rsquo; datasets that help to ensure consistency and simplify the discovery and exchange of key data.
To effectively respond to disasters and provide humanitarian aid, it is crucial to have accurate and up-to-date information. Standardized datasets like CODs play a critical role in providing consistent and reliable information about the demographics, geography, and infrastructure of a particular area.</description>
